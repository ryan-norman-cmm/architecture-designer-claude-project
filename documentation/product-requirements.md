## Problem & Solution

### Problem Statement

Technical teams struggle to make consistent, high-quality architectural decisions due to limited access to senior principal architect expertise. Architecture design sessions can take weeks of research, evaluation, and documentation, often resulting in suboptimal decisions due to lack of exposure to proven patterns, anti-patterns, and real-world case studies. Teams frequently over-engineer solutions or make technology choices misaligned with their actual constraints (team size, expertise, timeline, budget), leading to costly rewrites and technical debt. Without standardized Architecture Decision Records, critical context behind architectural choices is lost over time, making maintenance and evolution difficult.

**Who has this problem and how painful is it?**
- **Primary sufferer**: Software Architects and Technical Leads spend 2-3 hours per architecture decision researching patterns, evaluating technologies, and documenting decisions without access to comprehensive, curated architectural knowledge
- **Secondary impact**: Senior Engineers implementing architectures suffer from unclear guidance and lack of documented rationale when design documentation is incomplete or decisions are poorly communicated

### Solution Overview

Create a specialized Claude Desktop project that acts as a senior principal architect with 25+ years of experience, providing instant access to comprehensive architectural guidance through an interactive conversation interface. Users can submit product requirements and receive multiple architectural approaches with honest tradeoffs, detailed component designs, technology recommendations with specific versions, and professionally documented Architecture Decision Records.

**User-Facing Capabilities**
- Submit product requirements and receive 2-3 distinct architectural approaches with visual Mermaid diagrams
- Request detailed component architecture specifications including responsibilities, interfaces, dependencies, and technology choices
- Generate Architecture Decision Records that document major decisions with context, rationale, alternatives, and consequences
- Review existing architectures to identify risks, gaps, and improvement recommendations
- Explore technology selection with decision frameworks weighted by team expertise, timeline, and constraints
- Access 230K tokens of architectural knowledge including patterns, anti-patterns, scaling strategies, and real-world case studies

**Core Services**
- Knowledge Base Library: 5 comprehensive markdown files covering architectural patterns, technology selection, ADRs, anti-patterns, and scaling strategies
- Custom Instructions Engine: 2,800-word configuration defining agent persona, workflow, and quality standards
- Interactive Design Session: Conversational interface that guides users through requirements analysis, architecture exploration, and detailed design
- Visual Diagram Generation: Mermaid-based architecture diagrams for system context, components, sequences, and data flows

### Assumptions

- Knowledge base content will be created and maintained externally (not part of this initiative) with initial 230K tokens provided
- Users have access to Claude Desktop application with Projects feature enabled
- Architecture agent operates independently without integration to CMM internal services or healthcare-specific workflows
- Mermaid diagram rendering is handled by Claude Desktop's native capabilities

### Success Metrics

## Risks & Dependencies

**Business risks**:
- Knowledge base content quality directly impacts recommendation quality - requires significant upfront investment to create comprehensive 230K token knowledge base
- Agent effectiveness depends on users providing complete requirements (team size, expertise, budget, timeline, scale) - incomplete inputs yield generic recommendations
- Without maintenance, knowledge base becomes outdated as technology landscape evolves (framework versions, best practices, cost structures)
- Over-reliance on agent could reduce development of in-house architecture expertise if used as crutch rather than learning tool

**Dependencies**:
- Claude Desktop application must support Projects feature with custom instructions and knowledge base file uploads
- Mermaid diagram rendering must be available within Claude Desktop interface for visual architecture diagrams
- Initial knowledge base content (230K tokens across 5 files) must be created before project can launch
- Users must have sufficient technical background to evaluate architecture recommendations and make informed decisions
