# Comparison Table Template

Use this template to generate scannable architecture approach overviews.

## Architecture Approaches Overview

Based on your requirements for **[project description]**, here are **[N]** approaches optimized for **[key constraint]**:

| Approach | Key Pattern | Best For | Main Tradeoff |
|----------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **[Name 1]** | [Pattern in 30 chars] | [Use case in 50 chars] | [Tradeoff in 50 chars] |
| **[Name 2]** | [Pattern in 30 chars] | [Use case in 50 chars] | [Tradeoff in 50 chars] |
| **[Name 3]** | [Pattern in 30 chars] | [Use case in 50 chars] | [Tradeoff in 50 chars] |

**Platform Cohesion Scores:**
- **[Name 1]**: [High/Medium/Low] ([score]/100) - [1 sentence why]
- **[Name 2]**: [High/Medium/Low] ([score]/100) - [1 sentence why]
- **[Name 3]**: [High/Medium/Low] ([score]/100) - [1 sentence why]
