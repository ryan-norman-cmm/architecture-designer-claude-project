## Implementation Notes

### TDD Approach for Agent-Based Workflow
Since this is an agent-based conversational system (not traditional code), the TDD approach is adapted:

1. **Red Phase**: Write manual test scripts with expected behaviors and example conversations
2. **Green Phase**: Implement agent instructions, templates, and workflows to pass test scenarios
3. **Refactor Phase**: Organize templates, clarify instructions, improve structure

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Testing**: Primary approach using documented test scenarios
- **Example Sessions**: Complete walkthroughs demonstrating all features
- **Validation Checklists**: Automated checking where possible (element presence, diagram syntax)
- **Quality Metrics**: Track from session logs (follow-up questions, completeness scores)

### Technology Knowledge Base Maintenance
- Templates and technology options should be reviewed quarterly
- Version numbers only included when architecturally significant
- Tradeoff matrices based on common evaluation criteria

### Progressive Disclosure Implementation
- Agent instructions include explicit detail level indicators
- Each template has HIGH_LEVEL, STANDARD, and DETAILED variants
- Context tracking ensures consistent detail level within session

### Integration with REL-002
- Agent instructions reference REL-002 session handoff
- Architecture context loaded at initialization
- Component identification flows from REL-002 selections

---

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered complete when:

1. **Functionality**: All 6 artifact generators produce correct output
2. **Quality**: ≥90% of component specs include all 7 elements
3. **Rendering**: ≥80% of diagrams render correctly on first generation
4. **Efficiency**: Example sessions demonstrate <3 follow-up questions
5. **Continuity**: Smooth handoff from REL-002 demonstrated
6. **Documentation**: Complete example sessions for 3 architecture types

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Agent instructions too complex | Iterative refinement with test sessions |
| Template inflexibility | Progressive disclosure allows customization |
| Technology options outdated | Quarterly review process documented |
| Diagram rendering failures | Validation layer catches syntax errors |
| Progressive disclosure unclear | Explicit keywords and examples provided |
| Quality metrics hard to measure | Manual tracking in example sessions |
