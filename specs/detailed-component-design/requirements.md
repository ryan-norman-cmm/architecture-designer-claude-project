# Requirements: Detailed Component Design Generation (REL-003)

## Overview

Enable users to generate comprehensive, actionable component-level specifications from their selected architecture that guide implementation without requiring significant additional research.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Generate System Context Diagram
**As a** software architect
**I want to** generate a system context diagram showing external interactions
**So that I** can understand and document how my system interfaces with external actors and systems

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** a user has selected an architecture from REL-002
- **When** they request a system context diagram
- **Then** the system generates a diagram showing:
  - The system boundary
  - External actors (users, systems, services)
  - Data flows between system and external entities
- **And** the diagram renders correctly in Mermaid format
- **And** includes a textual description of each interaction

### Story 2: Generate Component Architecture Specifications
**As a** technical lead
**I want to** generate detailed specifications for each architectural component
**So that I** can guide my team's implementation with clear technical requirements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** a user has an architecture with identified components
- **When** they request component specifications
- **Then** the system generates specs containing all 7 required elements:
  1. Component responsibility (single paragraph)
  2. Interface definitions (API contracts, message formats)
  3. Dependencies (internal and external)
  4. Technology choices with versions where critical
  5. Scaling approach (horizontal/vertical, limits)
  6. Error handling strategy
  7. Monitoring approach with specific metrics
- **And** provides 2-3 technology options with tradeoffs when applicable
- **And** uses progressive disclosure (high-level first, details on request)

### Story 3: Generate Sequence Diagrams for Critical Workflows
**As a** developer
**I want to** see sequence diagrams for critical system workflows
**So that I** can understand the interaction patterns between components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** a user has defined components and their interfaces
- **When** they request sequence diagrams for critical workflows
- **Then** the system identifies 3-5 critical workflows based on:
  - Core business value flows
  - Complex interaction patterns
  - Error/exception scenarios
- **And** generates Mermaid sequence diagrams for each workflow
- **And** includes timing constraints and error paths
- **And** provides textual descriptions of each step

### Story 4: Generate Data Architecture Design
**As a** data architect
**I want to** receive comprehensive data architecture specifications
**So that I** can implement appropriate data storage and management strategies

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** a user needs data architecture design
- **When** they request data architecture specifications
- **Then** the system generates:
  - Data model diagrams (entities, relationships)
  - Storage technology recommendations (2-3 options with tradeoffs)
  - Data flow architecture (ingestion, processing, serving)
  - Data governance approach (retention, privacy, compliance)
  - Backup and recovery strategy
- **And** aligns storage choices with component requirements
- **And** includes sample schema definitions where applicable

### Story 5: Generate Deployment and Monitoring Architecture
**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want to** receive deployment architecture and monitoring specifications
**So that I** can set up infrastructure and observability correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** a user needs deployment and operational specifications
- **When** they request deployment architecture
- **Then** the system generates:
  - Deployment topology diagram
  - Infrastructure requirements (compute, storage, network)
  - CI/CD pipeline recommendations
  - Cost estimates (order of magnitude)
  - Environment strategy (dev, staging, prod)
- **And** when they request monitoring strategy
- **Then** the system provides:
  - Key metrics per component (golden signals)
  - Logging strategy and structure
  - Alerting thresholds and escalation
  - Dashboard recommendations
  - Observability stack recommendations

## Business Rules

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level summaries, provide details only when explicitly requested
2. **Technology Agnosticism**: Provide 2-3 technology options with clear tradeoffs unless user specifies preferences
3. **Version Specificity**: Only include version numbers when differences are architecturally significant
4. **Actionability Threshold**: All specifications must be detailed enough for implementation without extensive additional research
5. **Diagram Standards**: All diagrams must use Mermaid format and render correctly
6. **Continuity**: Designs must build naturally on architecture selected in REL-002

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Design generation completes within 30 seconds for standard complexity
- Diagram rendering completes within 2 seconds

### Usability
- Natural conversation flow continuing from REL-002
- Clear navigation between design artifacts
- Embedded diagrams within conversational responses

### Quality
- ≥90% of component specs include all 7 required elements
- ≥80% of diagrams render correctly on first generation
- <3 follow-up questions needed per design session on average

### Accessibility
- All diagrams include textual descriptions
- Content structured for screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation supported

## Testing Requirements

### E2E Test Scenarios
1. **Complete Design Generation Flow**
   - Start from REL-002 architecture selection
   - Request all 6 design artifacts progressively
   - Verify all required elements present
   - Confirm diagram rendering

2. **Progressive Disclosure Validation**
   - Request high-level component spec
   - Drill down into specific component details
   - Verify appropriate level of detail at each stage

3. **Technology Options Comparison**
   - Request data storage recommendations
   - Verify 2-3 options presented with tradeoffs
   - Select option and verify integration into design

### Test Environment
- Requires REL-002 architecture selection as prerequisite
- Sample architectures: e-commerce, SaaS platform, mobile backend
- Diagram rendering validation tools

### Test Data
- Pre-defined architecture contexts from REL-002
- Component specification templates
- Technology comparison matrices

## Dependencies

- **REL-002**: Architecture Exploration Workflow (must be complete)
  - Selected architecture as input
  - Component identification
  - Technology constraints

- **Diagram Generation**: Mermaid diagram library
- **Template System**: Structured design templates
- **Knowledge Base**: Technology options and tradeoffs database

## Out of Scope

- Automatic code generation from specifications
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Integration with external architecture tools (draw.io, Lucidchart)
- Cost calculation beyond order-of-magnitude estimates
- Detailed security threat modeling
- Performance testing specifications
- Database query optimization details
- Vendor-specific implementation guides
