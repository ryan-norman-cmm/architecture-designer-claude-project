# Test Scenario: Detailed Component Design Workflow (REL-003)

## Purpose
Validate that the extended workflow (Phase 6) generates actionable component-level specifications with all required elements.

## Test Case: Task Management Application

### Step 1: Simulate REL-002 Context (Architecture Selected)

**User Input:**
```
"I've selected the Modular Monolith approach for my task management app:
- Team: 3 engineers (TypeScript experience)
- Scale: 100-500 users initially, 5K in 12 months
- Timeline: 2 months to MVP
- Budget: Limited (bootstrapped)
- Pattern: Modular Monolith with Node.js + PostgreSQL"
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
- Acknowledges context from REL-002
- Confirms architecture selection
- Ready to proceed to detailed design

---

### Step 2: Request Detailed Design

**User Input:**
```
"Can you create detailed implementation specifications for this architecture?"
```

**Expected Agent Behavior:**
✅ Loads REL-002 context (team, scale, timeline, budget)
✅ Offers all 6 design artifacts
✅ Starts at STANDARD detail level (default)
✅ Begins with system context diagram

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Agent recalls team size (3 engineers)
- [ ] Agent recalls scale (100-500 users → 5K)
- [ ] Agent recalls timeline (2 months)
- [ ] Agent recalls budget (limited)
- [ ] Agent lists all 6 artifacts to be generated

---

### Step 3: Validate System Context Diagram

**Expected Output:**
- Mermaid C4 Context diagram
- Shows system boundary
- Lists external actors (users, systems)
- Data flows with protocols
- Textual descriptions

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Diagram renders correctly (Mermaid syntax valid)
- [ ] System boundary clearly defined
- [ ] 3-7 external actors identified
- [ ] Data flows labeled
- [ ] Each interaction has textual description

---

### Step 4: Validate Component Specifications

**Expected Output:**
Component specs for 5 modules (Auth, Tasks, Teams, Notifications, API Gateway)

**Validation for EACH Component:**
- [ ] **1. Responsibility:** Single paragraph present
- [ ] **2. Interfaces:** API endpoints or events defined
- [ ] **3. Dependencies:** Internal + external dependencies listed
- [ ] **4. Technology:** 2-3 options with tradeoffs provided
- [ ] **5. Scaling:** Approach, triggers, limits specified
- [ ] **6. Error Handling:** ≥2 failure modes with recovery
- [ ] **7. Monitoring:** Specific metric names provided

**Technology Options Check:**
- [ ] PostgreSQL presented as option with pros/cons
- [ ] Alternative database option presented (e.g., MongoDB)
- [ ] Tradeoffs explicitly stated

---

### Step 5: Test Progressive Disclosure

**User Input:**
```
"Give me more detail on the database schema design"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
✅ Raises detail level to DETAILED
✅ Provides schema with CREATE TABLE statements
✅ Includes indexes, constraints
✅ Provides example queries
✅ Design decisions explained

**Validation:**
- [ ] Response length increases (1500-2500 words)
- [ ] Code examples included (SQL)
- [ ] Technical depth appropriate for senior engineer

---

### Step 6: Test Technology Options

**User Input:**
```
"What are my options for the database?"
```

**Expected Output:**
**Option 1: PostgreSQL** ⭐ Recommended
- Why: Team expertise, relational data, mature
- Pros: ACID, rich queries, proven
- Cons: Vertical scaling limits
- Cost: $200-500/month at 5K users

**Option 2: MongoDB** (Alternative)
- Why: Flexible schema
- Pros: Horizontal scaling, document model
- Cons: No multi-document transactions (pre-v4), learning curve
- Cost: $300-600/month at 5K users

**Validation:**
- [ ] 2-3 options provided
- [ ] Explicit tradeoffs stated
- [ ] Cost estimates included
- [ ] Recommendation made with reasoning

---

### Step 7: Validate Sequence Diagrams

**Expected Output:**
- 3-5 critical workflows identified
- Mermaid sequence diagrams
- Error paths included (not just happy path)
- Performance targets specified

**Validation:**
- [ ] ≥3 workflows generated
- [ ] Diagrams include alt/error blocks
- [ ] Textual step-by-step descriptions
- [ ] P95 latency targets specified

---

### Step 8: Validate Deployment Architecture

**Expected Output:**
- Deployment topology diagram
- Infrastructure requirements (vCPU, RAM, storage)
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Monthly cost estimate

**Validation:**
- [ ] Topology diagram renders (Mermaid)
- [ ] Compute resources quantified
- [ ] Cost estimate provided (~$670/month for 5K users)
- [ ] Scaling projections included (10K, 50K users)

---

### Step 9: Validate Monitoring Strategy

**Expected Output:**
- Golden signals per component
- Logging structure (JSON format)
- Alert thresholds (critical, warning)
- Observability stack options (2-3)

**Validation:**
- [ ] Specific metric names provided (e.g., `http_requests_total`)
- [ ] Alert conditions with thresholds
- [ ] 2-3 observability tools presented (DataDog, Prometheus, New Relic)
- [ ] Tradeoffs for each tool stated

---

### Step 10: Test Artifact Navigation

**User Input:**
```
"Skip to deployment architecture - I want to understand costs first"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
✅ Jumps directly to deployment section
✅ Provides cost breakdown
✅ Offers to return to other artifacts

**Validation:**
- [ ] Agent navigates to requested artifact
- [ ] Doesn't force sequential flow
- [ ] Tracks what's been covered, what remains

---

## Success Criteria (Overall)

**Actionability (Primary Goal):**
- [ ] ≥70% confidence that specs are sufficient to start implementation
- [ ] No major gaps requiring significant additional research

**Completeness:**
- [ ] ≥90% of component specs include all 7 required elements
- [ ] All 6 design artifacts generated

**Conversation Efficiency:**
- [ ] <3 follow-up clarification questions needed
- [ ] Agent maintains context throughout session

**Diagram Quality:**
- [ ] ≥80% of diagrams render correctly
- [ ] All diagrams have complementary textual descriptions

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Conversation feels natural (not template-driven)
- [ ] Progressive disclosure works smoothly
- [ ] Can navigate between artifacts flexibly
