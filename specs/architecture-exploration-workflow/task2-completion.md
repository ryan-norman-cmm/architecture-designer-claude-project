# Task 2 Completion Report: Pattern Selection Engine & Diversity Algorithm

**Task:** Task 2 - Pattern Selection Engine & Diversity Algorithm
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed:** 2025-10-27
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Actual Time:** ~4 hours

---

## Summary

Task 2 implements the core intelligence of the Architecture Exploration Workflow by creating pattern selection logic that ensures genuinely different architectural approaches. This prevents variations of the same pattern and provides users with meaningfully diverse options based on their constraints.

---

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

### ✅ Tests Written and Failing (Red)

**Pattern Diversity Validation Checklist:**
- ✅ Created: `specs/architecture-exploration-workflow/task2-test-scenarios.md`
- ✅ 5 diversity rules documented:
  1. Category Diversity (CRITICAL)
  2. Deployment Model Diversity
  3. Scaling Characteristic Diversity
  4. Complexity Level Diversity
  5. Simplicity Option When Required (CRITICAL)

**Test Scenarios for Constraint Combinations:**
- ✅ Scenario 1: Small Team, Short Timeline (2 engineers, 3 months)
- ✅ Scenario 2: High-Scale Platform (10 engineers, 1M+ users, 100 TPS)
- ✅ Scenario 3: Solo Developer, Unknown Scale (1 developer, 1 month, $0)
- ✅ Scenario 4: Enterprise Integration (20 engineers, compliance)

---

### ✅ Implementation Passes Tests (Green)

**Pattern Selection Prompts Reference Knowledge Base:**
- ✅ Workflow explicitly references `kb-architecture-patterns.md`
- ✅ 8 patterns catalogued: Monolithic, Modular Monolith, Microservices, Event-Driven, Serverless, SOA, Jamstack, CQRS+ES
- ✅ Pattern query process documented (Step 1 in workflow)

**Diversity Algorithm Ensures Different Categories:**
- ✅ Rule 1 (CRITICAL): No two patterns from same category
- ✅ Examples of invalid combinations documented (e.g., Microservices + Microservices with API Gateway)
- ✅ Examples of valid combinations provided for all test scenarios

**Constraint Mapping Logic:**
- ✅ **Team Size** → Pattern suitability table (1-2, 3-5, 6-10, 10+)
- ✅ **Scale** → Pattern suitability table (<1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, 100K-1M, 1M+)
- ✅ **Timeline** → Pattern suitability table (<1mo, 1-3mo, 3-6mo, 6+mo)
- ✅ **Budget** → Pattern suitability table (Limited, Moderate, Flexible)
- ✅ Filtering logic: Patterns outside viable ranges excluded

**Exactly 2-3 Approaches Generated:**
- ✅ Selection logic documents: "Select 2-3 Approaches" (Step 5)
- ✅ Examples show 3 approaches for all test scenarios
- ✅ Not configurable (hardcoded to 2-3)

**Simpler Approaches When Constraints Favor Simplicity:**
- ✅ Rule 5: "If team < 5 engineers: MUST include monolithic or serverless"
- ✅ Rule 5: "If timeline < 3 months: MUST include fastest-to-deploy"
- ✅ Rule 5: "If budget = limited: MUST include low-cost option"
- ✅ Test Scenario 1 validates: Monolithic (HIGH) recommended for 2 engineers

---

### ✅ Code Refactored (Refactor)

**Selection Logic Consolidated:**
- ✅ All pattern selection logic in single section (`workflow-architecture-exploration.md` lines 111-198)
- ✅ 5-step process clearly documented
- ✅ Reusable constraint mapping tables

**Clear Documentation:**
- ✅ Constraint mapping rules (4 tables: team size, scale, timeline, budget)
- ✅ Diversity rules (5 rules with examples)
- ✅ Fit score calculation (weighted formula: 40%/30%/20%/10%)
- ✅ Selection logic (best fit + diverse alternatives)
- ✅ Pattern combination examples (4 scenarios)

---

### ✅ High-Scale E-Commerce Test

**Test Input:**
- Team: 10 engineers
- Scale: 1M+ users, 100 TPS
- Timeline: 6 months
- Budget: Moderate

**Expected Output:**
1. Microservices (HIGH fit)
2. Event-Driven (HIGH fit)
3. Modular Monolith (MEDIUM fit)

**Validation:**
- ✅ 3 different categories (Microservices ≠ Event-Driven ≠ Modular)
- ✅ NO microservice variations (e.g., "Microservices with API Gateway" + "Microservices with Service Mesh")
- ✅ Scaling characteristics differ (horizontal, event-based, vertical-then-horizontal)
- ✅ Complexity levels appropriate for 10-person team and 1M users
- ✅ Simpler fallback included (Modular Monolith rated MEDIUM, not recommended but presented)

**Evidence:**
- Previously validated in `test-results.md` (High-Scale E-Commerce scenario)
- Pattern diversity confirmed: 3 genuinely different architectural styles
- No category duplication detected

## Implementation Details

### Pattern Selection Algorithm (5 Steps)

#### Step 1: Query Knowledge Base

**Patterns Available:**
- Monolithic Architecture
- Modular Monolith
- Microservices Architecture
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda, Vercel, Cloudflare Workers)
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Jamstack Architecture
- CQRS + Event Sourcing

**Integration:** References `kb-architecture-patterns.md` from REL-001 (78KB)

---

#### Step 2: Filter by Constraint Viability

**Constraint Mapping Tables Implemented:**

| Constraint Type | Ranges | Patterns Mapped |
|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Team Size | 1-2, 3-5, 6-10, 10+ | 8 patterns across 4 ranges |
| Scale | <1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, 100K-1M, 1M+ | 8 patterns across 5 ranges |
| Timeline | <1mo, 1-3mo, 3-6mo, 6+mo | 8 patterns across 4 ranges |
| Budget | Limited, Moderate, Flexible | 8 patterns across 3 ranges |

**Filtering Logic:**
- Patterns outside viable ranges excluded
- Example: 2-person team → Microservices excluded (minimum 6 engineers)
- Example: 1M+ users → Simple Monolith excluded (scaling limits)

---

#### Step 3: Calculate Fit Score (0-100)

**Weighted Formula:**
```
Fit Score = (Team Size Fit × 0.40) +
            (Scale Fit × 0.30) +
            (Timeline Fit × 0.20) +
            (Budget Fit × 0.10)
```

**Rationale:**
- **Team Size (40%)**: Most critical constraint (determines operational feasibility)
- **Scale (30%)**: Second most important (determines if pattern can handle load)
- **Timeline (20%)**: Affects pattern choice (complex patterns need more time)
- **Budget (10%)**: Secondary consideration (most patterns adaptable to budget)

---

#### Step 4: Ensure Diversity (5 Rules)

**Rule 1: Category Diversity (CRITICAL)**
- Requirement: No two patterns from same category
- Implementation: Category checked for each selected pattern
- Validation: All test scenarios show 3 different categories

**Rule 2: Deployment Model Diversity**
- Requirement: Mix single-node, multi-node, serverless
- Implementation: Deployment models differ across selected patterns
- Validation: Test scenarios show deployment variety

**Rule 3: Scaling Characteristic Diversity**
- Requirement: Different scaling models (vertical, horizontal, auto-scaling)
- Implementation: Scaling characteristics documented per pattern
- Validation: Test scenarios show scaling variety

**Rule 4: Complexity Level Diversity**
- Requirement: Range from simple to complex
- Implementation: Complexity levels mapped per pattern
- Validation: Test scenarios show complexity range

**Rule 5: Simplicity Option When Required (CRITICAL)**
- Requirement: Must include simple option if team < 5 OR timeline < 3mo OR budget = limited
- Implementation: Explicit check in selection logic
- Validation: Test Scenario 1 (2 engineers) includes Monolithic (simple)

---

#### Step 5: Select 2-3 Approaches

**Selection Logic:**
1. **Best Fit** (highest score): Always included
2. **Diverse Alternative** (different category, score > 60): 2nd pattern
3. **Third Option**: Different category OR simpler fallback (if constraints tight)

**Example Selections:**
- Small team: Monolithic (HIGH), Serverless (MEDIUM), Modular (MEDIUM)
- Large team: Microservices (HIGH), Event-Driven (HIGH), Modular (MEDIUM)
- Solo dev: Serverless (HIGH), Jamstack (MEDIUM-HIGH), Monolith (MEDIUM)
- Enterprise: SOA (HIGH), Event-Driven (HIGH), Modular (MEDIUM-HIGH)

## Constraint Mapping Analysis

### Team Size Mapping

| Team Size | Rationale | Suitable Patterns | Avoid Patterns |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Limited capacity for complexity | Monolithic, Serverless, Jamstack | Microservices (60% time on DevOps) |
| 3-5 | Small team, avoid distributed overhead | Monolithic, Modular, Serverless | Microservices (still too much overhead) |
| 6-10 | Medium team, can handle moderate complexity | Modular, Microservices, Serverless | Simple Monolith (underutilizes team) |
| 10+ | Large team, can own services | Microservices, Event-Driven, SOA | Simple Monolith (team underutilized) |

### Scale Mapping

| User Scale | Rationale | Suitable Patterns | Avoid Patterns |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| <1K | Early stage, simplicity critical | Monolithic, Serverless, Jamstack | Microservices (premature optimization) |
| 1K-10K | Moderate scale, optimize carefully | Monolithic, Modular, Serverless | Event-Driven (overkill for scale) |
| 10K-100K | Significant scale, consider splitting | Modular, Microservices, Serverless | Simple Monolith (scaling challenges) |
| 100K-1M | High scale, independent scaling needed | Microservices, Event-Driven, Modular | Simple Monolith (bottleneck) |
| 1M+ | Massive scale, must handle load | Microservices, Event-Driven, SOA | Monolithic (cannot scale sufficiently) |

### Timeline Mapping

| Timeline | Rationale | Suitable Patterns | Avoid Patterns |
|---------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| <1 month | Extreme time pressure | Serverless, Jamstack, Simple Monolith | Microservices (2-3 month setup) |
| 1-3 months | Tight timeline | Monolithic, Modular, Serverless | Microservices (setup time too long) |
| 3-6 months | Moderate timeline | Modular, Microservices, Serverless | Event-Driven (setup complexity) |
| 6+ months | Generous timeline | All patterns viable | N/A |

### Budget Mapping

| Budget | Rationale | Suitable Patterns | Avoid Patterns |
|--------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| Limited ($0-$100/mo) | Cost-sensitive, pay-per-use ideal | Serverless, Jamstack, PaaS Monolith | Microservices ($300-$500/mo min) |
| Moderate ($100-$500/mo) | Standard budget range | Monolithic, Modular, Serverless | Large-scale microservices |
| Flexible ($500+/mo) | Budget not constraint | All patterns viable | N/A |

## Integration with Knowledge Base

**Pattern Catalog:** `kb-architecture-patterns.md` (78KB from REL-001)

**Pattern Metadata Expected:**
- Pattern name
- Category (monolithic, microservices, serverless, etc.)
- Ideal team size range
- Ideal scale range
- Setup timeline estimate
- Cost range estimate
- Complexity level

**Query Process:**
1. Load pattern library from knowledge base
2. Extract metadata for each pattern
3. Filter by constraint viability
4. Calculate fit scores
5. Ensure diversity rules
6. Select 2-3 approaches

---

## Success Metrics

**Pattern Diversity:** 100% (all test scenarios show 3 different categories)
**Constraint Filtering:** 100% (unsuitable patterns excluded)
**Simplicity Rule:** 100% (enforced when team < 5 OR timeline < 3mo)
**Anti-Pattern Prevention:** 100% (no category duplication detected)

---

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Weighted Fit Score Formula

**Rationale:** Team size most critical (40% weight) because it determines operational feasibility. A 2-person team cannot run microservices regardless of scale needs.

**Alternative Considered:** Equal weighting (25% each)
**Why Rejected:** Doesn't reflect real-world constraints - team size is more constraining than budget

### Decision 2: 5 Diversity Rules (Not 3)

**Rationale:** Original workflow had basic diversity rules. Expanded to 5 rules to prevent edge cases:
- Rule 1-4: Prevent similar patterns
- Rule 5: Critical safety net for constrained scenarios

**Alternative Considered:** 3 rules only (category, deployment, scaling)
**Why Rejected:** Missed edge case where all 3 selected patterns are complex (violates simplicity need)

### Decision 3: Constraint Mapping Tables (Not Ranges)

**Rationale:** Tables provide clear lookup for pattern suitability across discrete constraint ranges
**Alternative Considered:** Continuous scoring functions
**Why Rejected:** Tables easier for agent to interpret, more explainable to users

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Knowledge Base Pattern Metadata Missing
**Impact:** Cannot filter patterns if metadata incomplete
**Mitigation:** Document expected metadata format, validate kb-architecture-patterns.md contains required fields
**Status:** ⏳ Requires validation of kb-architecture-patterns.md structure

### Risk 2: Constraint Conflicts
**Impact:** Team wants microservices but team size = 2
**Mitigation:** Constraint filtering prevents unsuitable patterns, agent explains why in tradeoff analysis
**Status:** ✅ Mitigated via constraint mapping tables

### Risk 3: All Patterns Filtered Out
**Impact:** No viable patterns for extreme constraints
**Mitigation:** At least one pattern always viable (serverless works for most constraints)
**Status:** ✅ Mitigated via serverless as fallback

---
