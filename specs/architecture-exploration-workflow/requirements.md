# Requirements Specification

## Feature Overview

The Architecture Exploration Workflow enables users to submit product requirements through a conversational interface and receive 2-3 distinct architectural approaches. Each approach includes visual Mermaid diagrams (system context and component structure), honest tradeoff analysis, and contextual recommendations based on their specific constraints. This feature validates the hypothesis that users find value in exploring multiple approaches versus receiving a single recommendation.

**Target Users**: Software Architects, Senior Engineers, Technical Leads

**Business Value**: Enables informed architecture decisions by providing multiple perspectives with clear tradeoffs, reducing the risk of selecting an inappropriate architecture pattern that doesn't match team constraints.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Submit Product Requirements

As a Software Architect, I want to provide my product requirements and constraints through a conversational interface, so that I can receive architecture recommendations tailored to my specific context.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

**Given** I have accessed the Architecture Designer Claude Desktop project with REL-001 complete
**When** I describe my product requirements in natural language
**Then** the agent identifies and asks about any missing critical information (performance targets, scale expectations, team size, budget constraints)
**And** the agent confirms understanding by summarizing the requirements and constraints before proceeding

**Given** the agent has identified missing requirement details
**When** I provide the requested clarification
**Then** the agent incorporates the constraints into its analysis
**And** the agent proceeds to architecture exploration once requirements are complete

### Story 2: Receive Multiple Architecture Approaches

As a Technical Lead, I want to compare 2-3 different architectural approaches for my requirements, so that I can understand the tradeoffs and select the best fit for my team's constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

**Given** I have provided complete product requirements and constraints
**When** the agent processes my requirements
**Then** I receive exactly 2-3 distinct architectural approaches (not variations of the same pattern)
**And** each approach is presented with equal visual weight and detail

**Given** the agent presents multiple approaches
**When** I review each approach
**Then** I see a system context diagram showing external system interactions for each approach
**And** I see a component structure diagram showing internal architecture for each approach
**And** the diagrams are rendered as Mermaid diagrams (assuming rendering is available)

### Story 3: Evaluate Architecture Tradeoffs

As a Senior Engineer, I want to understand the honest pros and cons of each architectural approach, so that I can make an informed decision without being misled by silver bullet promises.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

**Given** the agent has presented 2-3 architectural approaches
**When** I review the tradeoff analysis
**Then** each approach includes clear pros based on my stated constraints (team size, expertise, timeline, budget)
**And** each approach includes explicit cons and limitations
**And** no approach is presented as having no downsides

**Given** I want to understand when simpler approaches are better
**When** the agent provides recommendations
**Then** the recommendations explain when a monolithic or simpler pattern is more appropriate than complex microservices
**And** the recommendations are contextualized to my specific constraints, not generic best practices

### Story 4: Request Clarification on Approaches

As a Software Architect, I want to ask follow-up questions about specific architectural approaches, so that I can fully understand the implications before making a decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

**Given** I have reviewed the initial architectural approaches
**When** I ask for clarification on a specific approach or pattern
**Then** the agent provides detailed explanation referencing the knowledge base
**And** the agent can suggest additional pattern variations from the architecture-patterns-library

**Given** I want to explore a pattern not in the initial 2-3 approaches
**When** I request information about a specific pattern (e.g., CQRS, Event Sourcing)
**Then** the agent explains how that pattern would apply to my requirements
**And** the agent compares it to the originally presented approaches

### Story 5: Select Architecture Approach

As a Technical Lead, I want to indicate my selected architectural approach, so that I can proceed to detailed component design in the next phase (REL-003).

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

**Given** I have reviewed all presented approaches and tradeoffs
**When** I indicate my selected approach
**Then** the agent confirms my selection and summarizes key implementation considerations
**And** the agent indicates readiness to proceed to detailed component design (when REL-003 is available)

## Business Rules

1. **Approach Diversity**: The 2-3 approaches must be genuinely different patterns (e.g., Monolithic vs Microservices vs Serverless), not minor variations of the same architecture
2. **Equal Presentation**: All approaches must be presented with equal visual prominence and detail level - no implicit bias toward complex solutions
3. **Honest Tradeoffs**: Every approach must include both advantages AND disadvantages - no silver bullets
4. **Context-Driven**: Recommendations must be based on stated constraints (team size, expertise, timeline, budget), not theoretical best practices
5. **Simplicity Advocacy**: When constraints favor simplicity, the agent must explicitly recommend simpler approaches over complex patterns
6. **Knowledge Base Usage**: The agent must reference patterns from architecture-patterns-library.md and anti-patterns from anti-patterns-case-studies.md
7. **Structured Consistency**: Despite conversational interface, output structure must be consistent across sessions for similar requirement types

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Response Time**: Architecture exploration (all 2-3 approaches) generated within 60 seconds of complete requirements submission
- **Diagram Generation**: Each Mermaid diagram renders within 5 seconds (dependent on Claude Desktop rendering capability)

### Usability
- **Conversational Flow**: Natural language interaction without requiring structured input format
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Agent asks for clarifications only when needed, not upfront questionnaire
- **Clear Comparison**: Approaches presented in comparable format enabling side-by-side evaluation

### Reliability
- **Consistency**: Same requirements should generate similar (though not identical) architectural approaches across sessions
- **Knowledge Base Access**: Agent must successfully access all 5 knowledge base files from REL-001 during exploration

### Scalability
- **Concurrent Users**: Support multiple independent conversation sessions (limited by Claude Desktop platform)
- **Knowledge Expansion**: Architecture exploration must continue to function when knowledge base expands in REL-004

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Validation Scenarios

1. **Simple CRUD Application**
   - Input: Basic user management system with 1000 users, 2-person team, 3-month timeline
   - Expected: Monolithic approach presented as one option with clear advantages for small team

2. **High-Scale E-commerce Platform**
   - Input: 1M+ users, 100+ transactions/second, 10-person team, 6-month timeline
   - Expected: Microservices and Event-driven approaches presented with scalability tradeoffs

3. **Startup MVP**
   - Input: Unknown scale, 1 developer, 1-month timeline, tight budget
   - Expected: Serverless or Monolithic recommended with explicit cost/complexity tradeoffs

4. **Enterprise Integration**
   - Input: Legacy system integration, compliance requirements, 20-person team
   - Expected: Service-oriented or API Gateway patterns with integration complexity acknowledged

### Test Data Requirements
- Example requirements documents covering different domains (e-commerce, SaaS, mobile backend)
- Constraint variations matrix (team size: 1-20, timeline: 1-12 months, budget: limited/moderate/flexible)
- Pattern coverage checklist ensuring all major patterns from knowledge base are accessible

### Validation Criteria
- Each test scenario generates 2-3 distinct approaches

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly excluded from this release:

1. **Detailed Component Specifications**: Deep implementation details deferred to REL-003
2. **Architecture Decision Records**: Formal ADR generation deferred to conditional REL-005
3. **Cost Estimation**: Infrastructure cost calculations deferred to future capability
4. **Evolution Path Planning**: Architecture scaling roadmaps deferred to future capability
5. **Automated Code Generation**: No implementation code, only architecture guidance
6. **Multi-Team Coordination**: Focus on single team/project decisions
7. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Single user conversation sessions only
8. **Custom Templates**: Fixed output format, no user customization

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Session Completion Rate**: ≥60% of users who start exploration view at least 2 architectural approaches
- **Multi-Approach Engagement**: ≥70% of users compare approaches before selecting (vs requesting single recommendation)
- **Requirements Completeness**: ≥80% of sessions include complete constraints after agent prompting

### Secondary Metrics
- **User Satisfaction**: ≥75% report exploration helped understand tradeoffs better than independent research
- **Approach Diversity**: 100% of sessions generate genuinely different patterns, not variations
- **Tradeoff Quality**: <20% of users report missing important pros/cons in analysis

### Failure Criteria
If metrics fall below thresholds for 2 consecutive weeks:
- Session completion <40%: Pivot to single recommendation workflow
- Single recommendation requests ≥60%: Simplify to primary approach with brief alternatives
- User satisfaction <50%: Investigate root causes through user interviews

### Measurement Approach
- Weekly metric reviews during initial 4-week adoption period
- Post-session optional surveys for qualitative feedback
- Conversation analysis to identify missing patterns or common clarification requests
