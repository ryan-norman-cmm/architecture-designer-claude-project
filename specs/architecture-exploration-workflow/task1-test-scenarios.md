# Task 1: Test Scenario Document - Conversation Flows

**Task:** Custom Instructions & Conversation State Management
**Created:** 2025-10-27
**Purpose:** Define expected conversation flows for validation

---

## Test Scenario 1: Complete Requirements Gathering (Happy Path)

### Input
**User:** "I need to build a user management system."

### Expected Conversation Flow

**Turn 1: Initial Response (Phase 1: Requirements Intake)**
- Agent acknowledges request
- Agent asks 2-4 clarifying questions about constraints:
  - Team size & expertise
  - Scale expectations
  - Timeline
  - Budget
  - Special requirements

**Turn 2: User Provides Partial Info**
**User:** "We have 2 engineers who know Python."

**Agent Response (Phase 2: Gap Identification)**
- Agent acknowledges received information (2 engineers, Python)
- Agent identifies missing constraints: scale, timeline, budget
- Agent asks for missing information

**Turn 3: User Provides More Info**
**User:** "We need it in 3 months, expecting 500-1000 users."

**Agent Response (Phase 2: Gap Identification - Continuing)**
- Agent acknowledges scale (500-1K) and timeline (3 months)
- Agent asks for remaining missing constraint: budget

**Turn 4: User Completes Requirements**
**User:** "Budget is limited, we're a startup."

**Agent Response (Phase 2 → Phase 3 Transition)**
- Agent provides requirements confirmation summary:
  - Product: User management system
  - Team: 2 engineers (Python expertise)
  - Scale: 500-1000 users
  - Timeline: 3 months
  - Budget: Limited (startup)
- Agent transitions to Phase 3: Architecture Exploration
- Agent generates 2-3 approaches

**Validation Criteria:**
- ✅ All 5 critical constraints captured (team, scale, timeline, budget, expertise)
- ✅ Agent asks follow-up questions for missing constraints
- ✅ Agent provides confirmation summary before exploration
- ✅ Context maintained across 4 turns (doesn't forget earlier constraints)

## Test Scenario 2: Incomplete Requirements (Gap Identification Test)

### Input
**User:** "Build me a website."

### Expected Conversation Flow

**Turn 1: Initial Response (Phase 1: Requirements Intake)**
- Agent acknowledges request
- Agent identifies VERY incomplete requirements
- Agent asks clarifying questions:
  - What does the website do? (functional requirements)
  - Team size & expertise
  - Scale expectations
  - Timeline
  - Budget

**Turn 2: User Provides Vague Info**
**User:** "It's for a small business, needs to be fast."

**Agent Response (Phase 2: Gap Identification)**
- Agent acknowledges "small business" context and "performance" requirement
- Agent still missing critical constraints
- Agent asks more specific questions:
  - How many employees/users?
  - What features needed? (e-commerce, blog, dashboard)
  - How many engineers on team?
  - Timeline and budget?

**Validation Criteria:**
- ✅ Agent doesn't proceed without critical constraints
- ✅ Agent continues asking until requirements are reasonably complete
- ✅ Agent doesn't make assumptions about missing constraints
- ✅ Agent can handle vague requirements gracefully

## Test Scenario 3: Multi-Turn Context Maintenance

### Input
**User:** "I need an e-commerce platform."

### Expected Conversation Flow

**Turn 1:** Agent asks about constraints

**Turn 2:**
**User:** "5 engineers"
**Agent:** Acknowledges 5 engineers, asks for other constraints

**Turn 3:**
**User:** "React and Node.js"
**Agent:** Acknowledges React/Node.js, asks for other constraints

**Turn 4:**
**User:** "6-month timeline"
**Agent:** Acknowledges 6 months, asks for other constraints

**Turn 5:**
**User:** "Expecting 10K-50K users"
**Agent:** Acknowledges 10K-50K users, asks for budget

**Turn 6:**
**User:** "Moderate budget"
**Agent:** Provides summary referencing ALL previous constraints:
- 5 engineers (from turn 2)
- React/Node.js (from turn 3)
- 6-month timeline (from turn 4)
- 10K-50K users (from turn 5)
- Moderate budget (from turn 6)

**Validation Criteria:**
- ✅ Agent maintains context across 6 turns
- ✅ Final summary includes all constraints from all turns
- ✅ Agent doesn't ask user to repeat information
- ✅ Agent remembers earlier turns when making recommendations

## Test Scenario 4: User Provides Complete Requirements Upfront

### Input
**User:** "I need to build a task management app. We have 3 engineers who know TypeScript and React. We expect 100-500 users initially, maybe 2-3K in a year. We need to launch in 2 months. Budget is limited - we're bootstrapped."

### Expected Conversation Flow

**Turn 1: Single-Turn Complete Requirements (Phase 1 → Phase 3)**
- Agent acknowledges ALL requirements in single turn
- Agent provides confirmation summary:
  - Product: Task management app
  - Team: 3 engineers (TypeScript/React)
  - Scale: 100-500 → 2-3K in 12 months
  - Timeline: 2 months
  - Budget: Limited (bootstrapped)
- Agent immediately transitions to Phase 3: Architecture Exploration
- Agent generates 2-3 approaches

**Validation Criteria:**
- ✅ Agent recognizes complete requirements in single turn
- ✅ Agent doesn't ask redundant questions when info already provided
- ✅ Agent proceeds directly to exploration phase
- ✅ Agent still provides confirmation summary before exploration

---

## Test Scenario 5: Phase Transitions

### Scenario: Requirements → Gap ID → Exploration → Clarification → Selection

**Phase 1: Requirements Intake**
- Input: User describes product
- Expected: Agent acknowledges, asks questions

**Phase 2: Gap Identification**
- Input: User provides partial constraints
- Expected: Agent identifies gaps, asks for missing info
- Transition Condition: All critical constraints provided

**Phase 3: Architecture Exploration**
- Input: Requirements complete
- Expected: Agent generates 2-3 approaches with diagrams and tradeoffs
- Transition Condition: Approaches presented

**Phase 4: Clarification**
- Input: User asks question about approach
- Expected: Agent provides detailed explanation, references knowledge base
- Transition Condition: User satisfied or selects approach

**Phase 5: Approach Selection**
- Input: User selects approach
- Expected: Agent confirms selection, provides next steps
- Transition Condition: User confirms selection

**Validation Criteria:**
- ✅ Agent follows phase sequence correctly
- ✅ Agent doesn't skip phases (e.g., exploration without requirements)
- ✅ Agent can return to earlier phases if needed
- ✅ Agent explicitly transitions between phases with clear signals
