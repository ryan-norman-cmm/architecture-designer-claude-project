## Feature Capabilities

### 1. Conversational Workflow (5 Phases)

**Phase 1: Requirements Intake**
- Gather functional requirements
- Identify critical constraints (team size, scale, timeline, budget, expertise)

**Phase 2: Gap Identification**
- Detect missing constraints
- Ask clarifying questions
- Provide requirements confirmation summary

**Phase 3: Architecture Exploration**
- Query knowledge base for patterns
- Filter by constraint viability
- Calculate fit scores (0-100)
- Ensure diversity (5 rules)
- Generate 2-3 approaches with diagrams

**Phase 4: Clarification**
- Answer user questions
- Compare approaches
- Explain tradeoffs in context
- Reference knowledge base

**Phase 5: Approach Selection**
- Confirm user selection
- Provide next steps
- Offer additional support (detailed design, ADR)

### 2. Pattern Selection Algorithm (5 Steps)

**Step 1: Query Knowledge Base**
- 8 patterns catalogued: Monolithic, Modular Monolith, Microservices, Event-Driven, Serverless, SOA, Jamstack, CQRS+ES

**Step 2: Filter by Constraint Viability**
- Team Size: 1-2, 3-5, 6-10, 10+ → Pattern suitability
- Scale: <1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, 100K-1M, 1M+ → Pattern suitability
- Timeline: <1mo, 1-3mo, 3-6mo, 6+mo → Pattern suitability
- Budget: Limited, Moderate, Flexible → Pattern suitability

**Step 3: Calculate Fit Score**
- Team Size Fit (40% weight)
- Scale Fit (30% weight)
- Timeline Fit (20% weight)
- Budget Fit (10% weight)
- Result: 0-100 score (HIGH 80-100, MEDIUM 60-79, LOW <60)

**Step 4: Ensure Diversity (5 Rules)**
1. Category Diversity (CRITICAL): No two from same category
2. Deployment Model Diversity: Single-node vs Multi-node vs Serverless
3. Scaling Characteristic Diversity: Vertical vs Horizontal vs Auto-scaling
4. Complexity Level Diversity: Simple → Moderate → Complex
5. Simplicity Option (CRITICAL): Must include if team <5 OR timeline <3mo OR budget limited

**Step 5: Select 2-3 Approaches**
- Best Fit (highest score)
- Diverse Alternative (different category, score >60)
- Third Option (different category OR simpler fallback)

### 3. Visual Communication

**Mermaid Diagram Templates:**
- System Context Diagram (external interactions)
- Component Structure Diagram (internal architecture)
- Consistent styling (colors, shapes, layouts)
- Pattern-specific variations

**Validated Patterns:**
- Monolithic: User → App → Database
- Microservices: User → API Gateway → Services → Databases
- Serverless: User → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB/S3

### 4. Honest Tradeoff Analysis

**5 Tradeoff Dimensions:**
1. Complexity (development, operational)
2. Scalability (vertical, horizontal, limits)
3. Cost (infrastructure, operational, hidden)
4. Team Fit (size appropriateness, expertise, coordination)
5. Timeline (time to production, iteration speed, setup)

**Structure:**
- Pros: 3-5 advantages (specific to constraints)
- Cons: 3-5 disadvantages (REQUIRED - no silver bullets)
- Best For: Ideal use cases
- Avoid If: Anti-patterns, warning signs
- Fit Score: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

### 5. Context-Driven Recommendations

**Key Principle:** Recommendations based on **stated constraints**, not theoretical best practices

**Examples:**
- Small team (3) → Monolithic recommended over Microservices
- Short timeline (2mo) → Avoid Microservices (3-6 month setup)
- Limited budget → Serverless pay-per-use over fixed-cost infrastructure
- High scale (1M+) → Microservices/Event-Driven over Monolithic

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Users Find Multi-Approach Overwhelming
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** High (core hypothesis fails)
**Mitigation:** Fit scores guide attention, clear recommendation provided
**Fallback:** Pivot to single-recommendation workflow with alternatives mentioned

### Risk 2: Constraint Filtering Too Restrictive
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (some valid patterns excluded)
**Mitigation:** At least one pattern always viable (serverless works for most)
**Fallback:** Adjust constraint tables based on user feedback

### Risk 3: Knowledge Base Patterns Insufficient
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Medium (limited pattern variety)
**Mitigation:** 8 patterns cover most use cases, REL-004 adds more
**Fallback:** Users can request additional patterns via clarification

### Risk 4: Diagram Rendering Issues
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Medium (visual communication degraded)
**Mitigation:** Mermaid syntax validated, templates tested
**Fallback:** Text-based diagrams if rendering fails
