# Workflow UX Improvements Requirements

## Overview
Refactor Architecture Exploration Workflow (v1.7 â†’ v1.8) to dramatically reduce cognitive load through progressive disclosure, conversational checkpoints, and scannable formats.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Summary-First Comparison Table
**As a** developer exploring architecture options
**I want to** see a high-level comparison table before detailed approaches
**So that** I can quickly understand my options without information overload

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** the system has gathered basic project requirements
**When** initial analysis is complete
**Then** display a comparison table with 3-5 approaches (50-75 lines max)
**And** each approach shows: name, key characteristics (3-5 bullets), best for (1-2 lines), tradeoffs (2-3 items)
**And** wait for user selection before generating details

### Story 2: Conversational Checkpoints
**As a** developer navigating the workflow
**I want to** have control points after each information segment
**So that** I can direct the conversation based on my needs

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** any information segment has been displayed
**When** the segment is complete
**Then** present a checkpoint with 2-3 contextual options
**And** always include "continue", "adjust", or "explain more" type choices
**And** wait for explicit user input before proceeding

**Given** user is at a checkpoint
**When** they select an option
**Then** respond with only the requested information (50-100 lines max)
**And** provide another checkpoint after completion

### Story 3: Decision Tables for Technology Choices
**As a** developer reviewing architecture approaches
**I want to** see technology decisions in scannable table format
**So that** I can quickly compare options without parsing prose

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** an architecture approach includes technology decisions
**When** presenting the approach
**Then** format each decision category as a table with columns: Technology, Why Chosen, Alternatives Considered, Trade-off
**And** limit prose to 1-2 sentence introductions per table
**And** use consistent table structure across all approaches

### Story 4: Progressive Requirements Gathering
**As a** developer starting architecture exploration
**I want to** answer one question at a time with context
**So that** I understand why each question matters

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** user initiates architecture exploration
**When** gathering requirements
**Then** ask only one question per exchange
**And** explain why the question matters (1-2 sentences)
**And** provide example answers or options when applicable

**Given** user provides an answer
**When** processing the response
**Then** acknowledge the answer briefly
**And** ask the next most relevant question based on their response
**And** skip questions that can be inferred from previous answers

### Story 5: Inline Learning Support
**As a** developer who may not know all architecture patterns
**I want to** see brief explanations with familiar analogies
**So that** I can understand recommendations without external research

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** an architecture pattern or technology is mentioned
**When** it's first introduced
**Then** provide a 2-3 sentence explanation using simple language
**And** include one real-world analogy when applicable
**And** format as an inline note or callout box

**Given** technical jargon is necessary
**When** using the term
**Then** follow with parenthetical plain English translation
**And** limit jargon to essential terms only

## Business Rules

1. **Information Chunk Size**: No single output exceeds 100 lines without a checkpoint
2. **Checkpoint Frequency**: Minimum one checkpoint every 50-100 lines of output
3. **Time to Value**: First actionable insight (comparison table) within 2 minutes of starting
4. **Question Limit**: Maximum 3 questions before showing initial value
5. **Table Priority**: Use tables for any comparison of 3+ items
6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with overview, drill down only on user request

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Response time for checkpoints: < 1 second
- Table generation: < 2 seconds
- Full approach detail generation: < 5 seconds

### Usability
- Reading level: 8th grade or below for explanations
- Scannable format: Headers, bullets, tables over paragraphs
- Mobile-friendly: Tables render correctly on small screens

### Accessibility
- Tables include proper headers for screen readers
- Clear visual hierarchy with markdown formatting
- Consistent structure throughout workflow

## Testing Requirements

### E2E Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: User completes full workflow with all checkpoints
2. **Early Exit**: User gets value from comparison table and exits
3. **Deep Dive**: User explores all details of one approach
4. **Course Correction**: User changes requirements mid-workflow
5. **Learning Mode**: User requests explanations at multiple points

### Test Environment
- Simulated user inputs at each checkpoint
- Measure output line counts per segment
- Validate table formatting consistency
- Time tracking for "time to first value"

### Test Data
- Simple CRUD application scenario
- Complex microservices scenario
- Legacy modernization scenario
- Startup MVP scenario

## Dependencies
- Existing workflow file (v1.7) as base for refactoring
- Knowledge base templates for comparison tables
- Markdown table rendering capability
- User input handling for checkpoints

## Out of Scope
- Backward compatibility with v1.7 workflow
- GUI/visual interface (remains CLI-based)
- Automated architecture diagram generation
- Integration with external architecture tools
- Multi-language support
- Saving/resuming sessions
- AI-powered requirement inference beyond simple cases

## Success Metrics
- **Cognitive Load**: Average lines per segment: 50-100 (vs current 500-1000)
- **Time to Value**: First insight in < 2 minutes (vs current 10 minutes)
- **User Control**: 8-10 checkpoints per session (vs current 3)
- **Conversation Length**: 8-12 exchanges typical (vs current 15-20)
- **Completion Rate**: 80% users reach comparison table (baseline TBD)
- **Understanding**: 90% users report clear understanding of recommendations
