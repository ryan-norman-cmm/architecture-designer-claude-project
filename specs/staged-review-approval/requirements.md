# Staged Review Approval Requirements

## Feature Overview
Add a staged review/approval workflow to the Architecture Designer agent that generates a minimal high-level solution overview for validation before investing effort in comprehensive documentation.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Generate Solution Overview
**As an** architect using the Architecture Designer
**I want to** generate a minimal high-level solution overview
**So that** I can validate the approach before detailed documentation is created

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** product requirements have been provided
- **When** the Architecture Designer processes the requirements
- **Then** it generates a solution overview (1 page max)
- **And** the overview contains only architect-level decisions
- **And** no detailed diagrams or implementation specifics are included

### Story 2: Review and Approve Overview
**As an** architect or technical lead
**I want to** review and approve the solution overview
**So that** I can confirm or refine the direction before full documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** a solution overview has been generated
- **When** the overview is presented to the user
- **Then** the user can respond with "approve", "refine", or "reject"
- **And** the system waits for explicit user input before proceeding
- **And** the approval decision is logged in the workflow state

### Story 3: Generate Full Documentation After Approval
**As an** architect
**I want to** proceed with full documentation generation only after approval
**So that** effort is focused on validated approaches

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the solution overview has been approved
- **When** the user confirms to proceed
- **Then** the full architecture documentation is generated (2-3 approaches, 10-15 pages, 8-12 diagrams)
- **And** the documentation builds upon the approved overview
- **And** the workflow state is updated to "documentation_complete"

### Story 4: Refine Solution Overview
**As an** architect
**I want to** provide feedback to refine the solution overview
**So that** the approach can be adjusted before full documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** a solution overview has been generated
- **When** the user selects "refine" and provides feedback
- **Then** the agent regenerates the overview incorporating the feedback
- **And** the refined overview is presented for approval again
- **And** the refinement history is tracked

## Business Rules

1. **Overview Size Constraint**: Solution overviews must not exceed 2 pages or 500 words (updated to match workflow template)
2. **Approval Required**: Full documentation generation (Phase 3: Architecture Exploration) is blocked until explicit approval is received
3. **Overview Content**: Must contain only high-level architectural direction (see Phase 2.5 template in workflow-architecture-exploration.md) - NO implementation details, diagrams, or code
4. **Refinement Limit**: Maximum of 3 refinement iterations before suggesting deeper requirements clarification
5. **Conversational Integration**: This is a workflow enhancement for Claude Desktop agent - no separate state management system needed, uses conversation context

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- Clear visual separation between overview (Phase 2.5) and full documentation (Phase 3) in conversation flow
- Explicit prompts for user decisions with 3 clear options: Approve / Refine / Reject
- Agent explicitly states which phase it's in and what comes next

### Conversational Experience
- Overview should be readable in < 2 minutes
- User understands they can stop before extensive documentation is generated
- Feedback mechanism is natural and conversational (not form-based)

### Knowledge Base Integration
- Workflow instructions added to workflow-architecture-exploration.md (already completed)
- Agent references Phase 2.5 template when generating overviews
- Consistent with existing workflow patterns (Phases 1-6)

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing Scenarios (Claude Desktop)
1. **Happy Path**: Use agent with real requirements → Verify Phase 2.5 triggers → Approve → Verify Phase 3 generates full documentation
2. **Refinement Path**: Provide feedback on overview → Verify agent regenerates → Approve → Verify continuation
3. **Rejection Path**: Reject overview → Verify agent returns to Phase 1
4. **Size Validation**: Manually verify generated overviews stay within 500-word limit
5. **Skip Override**: Test "skip overview, give me approaches" to verify agent can skip Phase 2.5 when explicitly requested

### Test Scenarios
- Simple CRUD application requirements
- Complex microservices architecture requirements
- Integration-heavy system requirements
- Ambiguous/incomplete requirements (should trigger clarification)

## Implementation Approach

This is a **conversational workflow enhancement**, not a code implementation:

1. ✅ **Already Completed**: Added Phase 2.5 to `output/workflow-architecture-exploration.md`
2. **Deployment**: Upload updated workflow file to Claude Desktop project knowledge base
3. **Agent Behavior**: Claude agent reads workflow file and follows Phase 2.5 instructions
4. **No Custom Code**: Works entirely through conversational instructions in knowledge base
5. **Testing**: Manual testing through Claude Desktop conversations

## Out of Scope

1. **Multiple Approval Levels**: No hierarchical approval chains (e.g., architect → manager → CTO)
2. **Partial Documentation Generation**: No ability to generate only specific sections after approval
3. **Comparison Tools**: No side-by-side comparison of multiple overview options
4. **Automated Approval**: No AI-based auto-approval based on criteria
5. **Version Control Integration**: No automatic Git commits at approval checkpoints
6. **Collaborative Review**: No multi-user simultaneous review features
7. **Cost Estimation**: No resource/cost analysis in the overview

## Success Metrics

1. **Reduction in Regeneration**: 70% decrease in full documentation regeneration due to approach changes
2. **Time to Validation**: Average time from requirements to approved overview < 5 minutes
3. **User Satisfaction**: 80% of users report improved confidence in final documentation
4. **Iteration Efficiency**: Average refinements per overview ≤ 1.5
