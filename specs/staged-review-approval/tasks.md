# Implementation Tasks

## Overview

**Feature:** Staged Review Approval Workflow (Phase 2.5)
**Type:** Conversational workflow enhancement (no code implementation)
**Total Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours (documentation + testing)

**Key Insight:** This is NOT a code implementation project. It's a workflow documentation enhancement that works through Claude Desktop's knowledge base.

---

## Task 1: Update Workflow Documentation ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Time Estimated:** 1.5 hours
**Time Actual:** 1.5 hours

### Objective
Add Phase 2.5 (Solution Overview & Approval Checkpoint) to the Architecture Exploration Workflow documentation.

### Deliverables
1. ✅ Added Phase 2.5 section to `output/workflow-architecture-exploration.md` (lines 97-246)
2. ✅ Defined solution overview template (500 words max)
3. ✅ Documented conversation patterns (approve/refine/reject)
4. ✅ Specified 5 critical rules for Phase 2.5
5. ✅ Updated version history to v1.2
6. ✅ Integrated with existing workflow phases (1-6)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Phase 2.5 clearly positioned between Phase 2 and Phase 3
- [x] Solution overview template includes all 6 sections
- [x] Conversation patterns cover approve, refine (max 3), and reject scenarios
- [x] 500-word hard limit explicitly stated
- [x] Skip override capability documented
- [x] Version history shows v1.2 changes

### Implementation Notes
- Inserted Phase 2.5 after Phase 2 (Gap Identification) and before Phase 3 (Architecture Exploration)
- Template format matches existing workflow documentation style
- Conversation patterns follow existing phase patterns (1-6)
- Critical rules prevent common failure modes (no limit enforcement, endless refinements, unclear options)

## Task 3: Manual Testing in Claude Desktop

**Status:** 🔲 Pending
**Time Estimated:** 1 hour
**Prerequisites:** Task 2 complete

### Objective
Validate that agent follows Phase 2.5 workflow correctly through manual conversation testing.

### Test Scenarios

#### 3.1 Happy Path Test
**Scenario:** Requirements → Overview → Approve → Full Documentation

1. Start new conversation in Architecture Designer project
2. Provide complete product requirements (e.g., "Build a task management app for 3 engineers, 100-500 users, 2-month timeline")
3. Verify agent triggers Phase 2.5 after requirements gathering
4. Verify agent generates solution overview (< 500 words)
5. Verify agent presents 3 options (Approve/Refine/Reject)
6. Respond with "Approve"
7. Verify agent proceeds to Phase 3 (generates 2-3 approaches with diagrams)

**Expected Result:** Agent follows Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 2.5 → Phase 3 flow

#### 3.2 Refinement Path Test
**Scenario:** Requirements → Overview → Refine → Updated Overview → Approve

1. Start new conversation
2. Provide product requirements
3. Wait for solution overview
4. Respond with refinement feedback (e.g., "Budget is more constrained")
5. Verify agent regenerates overview with updated assumptions
6. Verify agent re-presents overview for approval
7. Respond with "Approve"
8. Verify agent proceeds to Phase 3

**Expected Result:** Agent incorporates feedback and allows up to 3 refinements

#### 3.3 Rejection Path Test
**Scenario:** Requirements → Overview → Reject → Restart

1. Start new conversation
2. Provide requirements
3. Wait for solution overview
4. Respond with "Reject" or "This isn't what I need"
5. Verify agent acknowledges misunderstanding
6. Verify agent returns to Phase 1 (requirements clarification)

**Expected Result:** Agent gracefully handles rejection and restarts requirements gathering

#### 3.4 Size Constraint Test
**Scenario:** Verify overviews stay within 500-word limit

1. Test with simple requirements (CRUD app)
2. Test with complex requirements (microservices system)
3. Manually count words in generated overviews
4. Verify all overviews ≤ 500 words

**Expected Result:** Overviews respect hard 500-word limit

#### 3.5 Skip Override Test
**Scenario:** User explicitly requests skipping Phase 2.5

1. Start new conversation
2. Provide requirements and say "skip overview, give me approaches"
3. Verify agent skips Phase 2.5 and goes directly to Phase 3

**Expected Result:** Agent respects explicit skip request

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Happy path works (5/5 test conversations)
- [ ] Refinement incorporates feedback (3/3 tests)
- [ ] Rejection returns to Phase 1 (3/3 tests)
- [ ] Overviews stay within 500 words (10/10 tests)
- [ ] Skip override works when explicitly requested

### Test Documentation
Document results in: `specs/staged-review-approval/testing-results.md`

Include:
- Test date/time
- Scenario tested
- Actual agent behavior
- Pass/Fail
- Issues encountered
- Screenshots (optional)

## Task 4: Iterate Based on Testing Feedback

**Status:** 🔲 Pending
**Time Estimated:** 30 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Task 3 complete

### Objective
Refine Phase 2.5 instructions based on manual testing results and agent behavior.

### Potential Adjustments

#### If agent doesn't trigger Phase 2.5:
- Add explicit "MUST trigger Phase 2.5 after Phase 2" to critical rules
- Add trigger phrase examples in workflow
- Clarify integration points with existing phases

#### If overviews exceed 500 words:
- Emphasize word limit more strongly in template
- Add example overviews that demonstrate brevity
- Simplify template sections

#### If approval prompts unclear:
- Revise conversation pattern language
- Add more example user responses
- Clarify what each option does

#### If refinements don't incorporate feedback:
- Add guidance on feedback interpretation
- Provide refinement examples
- Clarify regeneration process

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All critical issues from testing addressed
- [ ] Workflow file updated with improvements
- [ ] Re-uploaded to Claude Desktop project
- [ ] Re-tested to verify fixes

### Implementation Notes
- Keep changes minimal and targeted
- Maintain consistency with existing workflow patterns
- Document changes in version history
- Re-test after each adjustment

## Why This Isn't a Code Implementation

This spec might initially look like it needs software development, but it doesn't:

### What It's NOT:
- ❌ Building APIs, databases, or state management systems
- ❌ Writing TypeScript/Python/JavaScript code
- ❌ Creating UI components or approval interfaces
- ❌ Setting up infrastructure or deployment pipelines
- ❌ Writing automated tests or CI/CD workflows

### What It IS:
- ✅ Enhancing conversational workflow instructions
- ✅ Documenting conversation patterns for Claude agent
- ✅ Adding phase to existing workflow structure
- ✅ Defining templates and guidelines
- ✅ Manual testing through actual conversations

### Why This Works:
Claude Desktop projects work by:
1. Uploading knowledge base files (markdown documents)
2. Agent reads files during conversations
3. Agent follows instructions in files
4. No code execution - just instruction-following

Phase 2.5 works the same way:
1. Workflow file tells agent "after Phase 2, generate overview"
2. Workflow file provides overview template
3. Workflow file defines conversation patterns
4. Agent reads and follows these instructions
5. User interacts through natural conversation

This is the Claude Desktop paradigm - **instructions, not code**.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** - Upload workflow file to Claude Desktop project (15 min)
2. **Test** - Run through 5 test scenarios manually (1 hour)
3. **Iterate** - Refine based on agent behavior (30 min)
4. **Document** - Capture results and mark complete (15 min)

**Total remaining effort:** ~2 hours
