## Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: Conversational Workflow vs Code Implementation

**Context:** Need staged approval workflow for Architecture Designer agent

**Decision:** Implement as conversational workflow instructions in knowledge base file

**Rationale:**
- Claude Desktop projects work through markdown knowledge base files
- Existing workflow already conversational (Phases 1-6)
- No infrastructure needed - agent reads and follows instructions
- Faster to deploy and iterate
- Matches Claude Desktop paradigm

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Code implementation** (TypeScript/React components)
   - Rejected: Claude Desktop doesn't support custom code execution
   - Would require building separate web app

2. **External approval system** (via MCP server)
   - Rejected: Over-engineering for conversational workflow
   - Adds complexity and dependencies

**Tradeoffs:**
- Pro: Simple, no code to maintain, works within Claude Desktop
- Pro: Easy to iterate based on user feedback
- Pro: Deployment is just file upload
- Con: No programmatic enforcement (relies on agent following instructions)
- Con: Manual testing only (no automated tests)

**Status:** Implemented ✅

### ADR-002: 500-Word Limit for Solution Overviews

**Context:** Need to keep overviews concise for quick review while providing enough architectural context

**Decision:** Set overview limit to 500 words (approximately 2 pages)

**Rationale:**
- Need enough space for 6 template sections (Problem, Direction, Assumptions, Principles, Enables, Defers)
- 500 words readable in < 2 minutes (meets usability requirement)
- Matches "1-2 pages" mentioned in requirements
- Forces focus on high-level direction, not implementation details

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **250 words** (1 page)
   - Rejected: Too restrictive for meaningful architectural overview
   - Would sacrifice important context

2. **1000 words** (4 pages)
   - Rejected: Too long to review quickly
   - Defeats purpose of minimal overview

3. **No limit** (just "keep it concise")
   - Rejected: Too vague, could lead to creep toward detailed docs

**Tradeoffs:**
- Pro: Readable in < 2 minutes
- Pro: Forces brevity and focus
- Pro: Clear, measurable constraint
- Con: May feel restrictive for complex systems
- Con: Requires agent to prioritize information

**Status:** Implemented ✅

---

### ADR-003: Maximum 3 Refinement Iterations

**Context:** Need to prevent endless refinement loops while allowing iterative improvement

**Decision:** Limit refinement iterations to 3 per overview

**Rationale:**
- If not aligned after 3 tries, requirements need deeper work
- Keeps workflow moving forward
- Agent suggests requirements clarification after limit hit
- Balances iteration flexibility with forward progress

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Unlimited refinements**
   - Rejected: Could lead to endless loops
   - No forcing function to return to requirements clarification

2. **1 refinement only**
   - Rejected: Too restrictive for complex requirements
   - User may need multiple adjustments to get alignment

3. **5 refinements**
   - Rejected: Too many, indicates requirements misunderstanding

**Tradeoffs:**
- Pro: Prevents endless loops
- Pro: Forces requirements clarification when needed
- Pro: Reasonable number of iterations for most cases
- Con: May feel restrictive in rare edge cases
- Con: Hard limit (not adaptive)

**Status:** Implemented ✅

---

### ADR-004: ADR-Ready Decisions in Phase 3 (Not Phase 6)

**Context:** Users want to generate ADRs without creating detailed component design (Phase 6)

**Decision:** Capture technology decision context in Phase 3 (Architecture Exploration) with format: Decision, Rationale, Alternatives, Tradeoffs

**Rationale:**
- Most teams don't need Phase 6 (detailed component design)
- Decision context captured while fresh during approach comparison
- Enables ADR generation in 10-15 minutes vs 1-2 hours for Phase 6
- Decisions tied to requirements and architectural principles
- Natural fit in Phase 3 (already discussing technology choices)

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Require Phase 6 for ADRs**
   - Rejected: Too time-consuming (1-2h) for most teams
   - Over-engineering for decision documentation

2. **Separate ADR capture phase** (Phase 3.5)
   - Rejected: Duplicates work already done in Phase 3
   - Adds unnecessary workflow step

3. **Generate ADRs from overview** (Phase 2.5)
   - Rejected: Overview too high-level for decision context
   - Lacks alternatives and tradeoffs analysis

**Tradeoffs:**
- Pro: Fast path to ADRs (10-15 min vs 1-2h)
- Pro: Captures decisions while context is fresh
- Pro: Phase 6 becomes optional for most teams
- Con: May feel like more work in Phase 3
- Con: Requires agent to structure decisions consistently

**Status:** Implemented ✅

---

### ADR-005: Web Search for Technology Research (Phase 2.75)

**Context:** Knowledge base may have outdated technology information

**Decision:** Add optional Phase 2.75 for web search research of technology capabilities when specific technologies mentioned in requirements

**Rationale:**
- Technology capabilities change rapidly
- Knowledge base may be outdated (training data cutoff)
- Web search provides current version features
- 5-10 minute time limit keeps it focused
- Only triggered when technologies explicitly mentioned

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Always rely on knowledge base**
   - Rejected: May provide outdated information
   - Could lead to wrong architectural decisions

2. **Always perform web search**
   - Rejected: Adds time to every workflow
   - Unnecessary when knowledge base is sufficient

3. **External API integration** (product documentation APIs)
   - Rejected: Over-engineering for simple research
   - Requires maintenance of API integrations

**Tradeoffs:**
- Pro: Up-to-date technology information
- Pro: Informed architectural decisions
- Pro: Optional (skip if not needed)
- Con: Adds 5-10 minutes to workflow
- Con: Requires web search capability

**Status:** Implemented ✅

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Approach

**Why Manual:** Conversational workflow requires human evaluation of agent responses

### Test Coverage

**7 Scenarios, 19 Test Cases:**

1. **Happy Path** (2 cases)
   - Simple CRUD application
   - Complex microservices system

2. **Refinement Path** (3 cases)
   - Budget constraint refinement
   - Timeline constraint refinement
   - Multiple refinements (max 3)

3. **Rejection Path** (1 case)
   - Misunderstood requirements

4. **Size Validation** (10 cases)
   - Verify all overviews ≤ 500 words

5. **Skip Override** (1 case)
   - Explicit request to skip Phase 2.5

6. **Technology Research** (1 case)
   - Phase 2.75 web search functionality

7. **ADR Generation** (1 case)
   - Generate ADRs from Phase 3 without Phase 6

### Success Criteria

- Agent triggers Phase 2.5 consistently (≥90% after Phase 2)
- Overviews stay within 500-word limit (100% compliance)
- User approval required before Phase 3 (100% enforcement)
- Refinements incorporate feedback (≥80% of requests)
- Overall workflow feels natural and helpful

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Conversational paradigm** - Perfect fit for Claude Desktop projects
2. **Incremental versioning** - v1.2 → v1.3 → v1.4 allowed iterative refinement
3. **Clear templates** - 500-word limit and 6-section structure forces focus
4. **ADR-ready decisions** - Solves "too much work" problem with Phase 6
5. **Web search integration** - Addresses outdated knowledge base concern

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Testing automation** - Manual testing is time-consuming
2. **Metrics tracking** - No built-in way to track success metrics
3. **Collaborative review** - Single-user limitation
4. **Adaptive limits** - 500-word limit and 3-refinement limit are fixed

### Key Insights
1. **Instructions > Code** - Claude Desktop paradigm works through instructions, not code
2. **Minimal overviews are hard** - 500 words is tight constraint, requires discipline
3. **ADR generation is the goal** - Most teams don't need Phase 6 details
4. **Technology research is valuable** - Web search for current capabilities matters
