# Architecture Design Document

## Overview
**Feature:** Staged Review Approval Workflow
**Purpose:** Add Phase 2.5 checkpoint to Architecture Exploration Workflow that generates minimal solution overviews for validation before comprehensive documentation generation
**Type:** Conversational workflow enhancement (not code implementation)

## Design Approach

### Conversational Workflow Pattern

This enhancement follows Claude Desktop's **conversational workflow** paradigm:
- No custom code or components to build
- No APIs, databases, or state management systems
- Works through instructions in knowledge base files
- Agent reads workflow file and follows conversation patterns
- State tracked implicitly through conversation context

### Integration Point

Adds **Phase 2.5: Solution Overview & Approval Checkpoint** between:
- **Phase 2**: Gap Identification (requirements complete)
- **Phase 3**: Architecture Exploration (generate 2-3 approaches)

### Design File Modified

**File:** `output/workflow-architecture-exploration.md`
**Location:** Line 97-246 (Phase 2.5 section)
**Version:** v1.2

## Workflow Design

### Phase 2.5 Flow

```
Phase 1-2: Requirements Intake & Gap Identification
    ‚Üì
Phase 2.5: Solution Overview & Approval (NEW)
    ‚Üì
    Generate Minimal Overview (500 words max)
    ‚Üì
    Present to User with 3 Options:
    - ‚úÖ Approve ‚Üí Continue to Phase 3
    - üîÑ Refine ‚Üí Regenerate overview with feedback
    - ‚ùå Reject ‚Üí Return to Phase 1
    ‚Üì
Phase 3: Architecture Exploration (blocked until approval)
    ‚Üì
    Generate 2-3 Approaches with Diagrams
```

### Solution Overview Template

**Structure** (500 words maximum):

1. **Problem Understanding** (2-3 sentences)
   - Confirms what problem we're solving

2. **Proposed Architectural Direction** (1 paragraph)
   - High-level approach (NOT implementation details)
   - Examples: "Modular monolith", "Event-driven microservices", "Serverless"

3. **Key Assumptions** (bulleted list)
   - Team constraints
   - Scale targets
   - Timeline
   - Budget
   - Critical requirements

4. **Architectural Principles** (3-5 principles)
   - Guiding decisions for this specific solution
   - Examples: "Optimize for velocity over scale", "Minimize operational complexity"

5. **What This Enables** (2-3 sentences)
   - User capabilities from this architecture

6. **What This Defers** (2-3 items)
   - Intentionally not solving in initial design
   - Examples: "Multi-region deployment", "Real-time collaboration"

### Conversation Patterns

#### After Phase 2 Complete

```
Agent: "Before I generate 2-3 detailed architectural approaches with diagrams
and tradeoff analysis, let me confirm we're aligned on the high-level direction.

Here's my solution overview for your [project]:

[Generate overview using template - max 500 words]

---

**Review Questions:**
- Does this match your understanding of the problem?
- Is the proposed direction reasonable given your constraints?
- Any critical assumptions I got wrong?

**Your Options:**
1. ‚úÖ **Approve** - Proceed to generate 2-3 detailed architectural approaches
2. üîÑ **Refine** - Adjust assumptions/direction and regenerate overview
3. ‚ùå **Reject** - We misunderstood the problem, restart requirements gathering

What would you like to do?"
```

#### User Approves

```
User: "Looks good, proceed"

Agent: "Perfect! I'll now generate 2-3 distinct architectural approaches with:
- System context diagrams
- Component structure diagrams
- Detailed tradeoff analysis
- Technology recommendations
- Fit scores

This will take a moment as I reference the knowledge base..."

[Proceed to Phase 3]
```

#### User Refines

```
User: "Actually, budget is more constrained"

Agent: "Got it! Let me update the solution overview with tighter budget constraints.

Here's the revised overview:

[Regenerate with updated assumptions]

Does this better match your needs?"

[Allow up to 3 refinement iterations]
```

#### User Rejects

```
User: "No, this isn't what I need"

Agent: "I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let's step back and clarify
the requirements.

What specifically did I get wrong?
- Problem understanding?
- Constraints?
- Priorities?

Let's restart from Phase 1 with better clarity."

[Return to Phase 1]
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Conversational vs Code Implementation

**Decision:** Implement as conversational workflow instructions
**Rationale:**
- Claude Desktop projects work through knowledge base files, not code
- Existing workflow pattern already conversational (Phases 1-6)
- No infrastructure needed - agent reads instructions and follows them
- Faster to deploy - just update knowledge base file

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Simple, no code to maintain
- ‚úÖ Works within Claude Desktop paradigm
- ‚úÖ Easy to iterate based on user feedback
- ‚ùå No programmatic enforcement (relies on agent following instructions)
- ‚ùå Manual testing only (no automated tests)

### 2. 500-Word Limit (not 250)

**Decision:** Set overview limit to 500 words (2 pages)
**Rationale:**
- Need enough space for complete overview template sections
- 250 words too restrictive for meaningful architectural direction
- 500 words readable in < 2 minutes (meets usability goal)
- Matches "1-2 pages" mentioned in requirements

### 3. Phase Placement (2.5 vs New Phase)

**Decision:** Insert as Phase 2.5 between Gap Identification and Architecture Exploration
**Rationale:**
- Logical checkpoint after requirements complete
- Blocks expensive Phase 3 work until validated
- Doesn't disrupt existing phase numbering significantly
- Clear trigger point (requirements complete)

### 4. Maximum 3 Refinements

**Decision:** Limit refinement iterations to 3
**Rationale:**
- Prevents endless refinement loops
- If not aligned after 3 tries, requirements need deeper work
- Keeps workflow moving forward
- Agent suggests requirements clarification after limit hit

### 5. Skip Override Capability

**Decision:** Allow users to skip Phase 2.5 with explicit request
**Rationale:**
- Some users may want full exploration immediately
- Experienced architects may not need validation checkpoint
- Maintains flexibility
- Example trigger: "skip overview, give me approaches"

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing in Claude Desktop

1. **Upload updated workflow file** to project knowledge base
2. **Test happy path:** Requirements ‚Üí Overview ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Full docs
3. **Test refinement:** Requirements ‚Üí Overview ‚Üí Refine ‚Üí Approve
4. **Test rejection:** Requirements ‚Üí Overview ‚Üí Reject ‚Üí Restart
5. **Verify 500-word limit** on generated overviews
6. **Test skip override:** Explicit request to skip Phase 2.5

### Test Scenarios

- Simple requirements (CRUD app)
- Complex requirements (microservices system)
- Ambiguous requirements (should trigger clarification)
- Budget-constrained project
- Timeline-constrained project

### Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Agent consistently triggers Phase 2.5 after Phase 2
- ‚úÖ Overviews stay within 500-word limit
- ‚úÖ Approval blocks Phase 3 until explicit user decision
- ‚úÖ Refinements incorporate user feedback
- ‚úÖ Rejections return to Phase 1
- ‚úÖ Skip requests bypass Phase 2.5

## Deployment

### Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `output/workflow-architecture-exploration.md` - Added Phase 2.5 (lines 97-246)
2. ‚úÖ Updated version history to v1.2

### Deployment Steps

1. ‚úÖ Update workflow file (completed)
2. Upload updated file to Claude Desktop project knowledge base
3. Test with sample conversations
4. Iterate based on agent behavior
5. Document any adjustments needed

### Rollback Plan

If Phase 2.5 doesn't work as expected:
- Revert to workflow v1.1 (remove Phase 2.5 section)
- Re-upload to knowledge base
- Agent returns to direct Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3 flow

## Future Enhancements

### Not in Current Scope

1. **Comparison tools:** Side-by-side comparison of multiple refined overviews
2. **Collaborative review:** Multiple stakeholders approving overview
3. **Version control integration:** Git-based approval workflows
4. **Partial documentation generation:** Generate single approach from overview
5. **Cost estimation in overview:** Infrastructure cost projections
6. **Automated approval:** Based on confidence scores or constraints

### Possible Future Iterations

- Add Phase 5.5: Approval checkpoint before detailed component design (Phase 6)
- Template variations for different project types (greenfield, migration, scaling)
- Learning from refinement patterns to improve initial overviews
- Integration with external requirements management systems
