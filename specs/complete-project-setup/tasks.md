    - Expected: Flags missing HIPAA, data residency, audit requirements

- [ ] **Success Criteria Thresholds**:
  - Persona Consistency: ≥95% (19/20 tests)
  - Healthcare Context: 100% of healthcare prompts mention compliance
  - Knowledge Base References: ≥80% (agent cites specific files)
  - Multi-Approach: ≥90% provide 2-3 options
  - Azure Priority: ≥80% recommend Azure first

- [ ] **Validation Spreadsheet Created**:
  - Columns: Test ID, Category, Prompt, Expected Behavior, Actual Behavior, Pass/Fail, Notes
  - 20 rows for test cases
  - Summary section with success rate per category

- [ ] **Failure Scenarios Documented**:
  - Generic responses (not healthcare-focused)
  - Single approach recommendations (no tradeoffs)
  - Missing compliance mentions
  - AWS prioritized over Azure
  - No knowledge base references
  - Acceptance of vague requirements

- [ ] **Remediation Guidance Provided**:
  - If persona inconsistent: Review custom instructions, strengthen healthcare persona
  - If no KB references: Verify files uploaded, check token count
  - If generic responses: Add more healthcare examples to knowledge base
  - If compliance missing: Strengthen compliance sections in patterns

### Files to Create
- [ ] `/Users/rnorman/Projects/architecture-designer-claude-project/docs/VALIDATION.md`
- [ ] `/Users/rnorman/Projects/architecture-designer-claude-project/test-suite/validation-prompts.md` (20 prompts)
- [ ] `/Users/rnorman/Projects/architecture-designer-claude-project/test-suite/validation-spreadsheet.csv`
- [ ] `/Users/rnorman/Projects/architecture-designer-claude-project/test-suite/expected-responses.md` (sample responses)
- [ ] `/Users/rnorman/Projects/architecture-designer-claude-project/test-suite/remediation-guide.md`

### Test Approach
1. **Test Prompt Design**: Create 20 prompts covering all 6 categories
2. **Expected Response Definition**: Document 2-3 key characteristics per prompt
3. **Execution**: Run all 20 prompts against configured project
4. **Scoring**: Record pass/fail for each test
5. **Analysis**: Calculate success rate per category
6. **Remediation**: If <95% overall, identify and fix root causes
7. **Retest**: Run failed tests after remediation

### Notes
- Include example responses for reference
- Document how to recognize successful vs failed responses
- Create reusable test suite for future knowledge base updates
- Consider persona drift over time (retest quarterly?)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Token limit exceeded (>240K) | High | Monitor token counts during generation (Tasks 1-4) |
| Insufficient healthcare focus | High | Validate with healthcare-specific test prompts (Task 7) |
| Missing compliance coverage | Critical | Audit each file for HIPAA/SOX/SOC 2 mentions (Tasks 1-4) |
| Generic responses from agent | Medium | Strengthen healthcare examples, retest (Task 7) |
| Setup time exceeds 2 hours | Low | Streamline documentation, test with independent architect (Task 6) |
| Knowledge base files too technical | Medium | Add executive summaries, real-world examples |
| Claude Code generation quality | Medium | Manual review of first iteration, iterate as needed |

## Notes
- This is a documentation/content generation project, not code implementation
- No automated setup tools - this is manual configuration
- Focus on healthcare enterprise architecture with compliance emphasis
- Azure cloud platform prioritized throughout
- Agent persona: Senior principal architect with 25+ years experience
- Success depends on comprehensive knowledge base (~230K tokens)
- Validation critical: Must exhibit healthcare compliance awareness in all responses
