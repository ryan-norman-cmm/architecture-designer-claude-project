# Architecture Design Document

## Overview
**Feature:** Complete Project Setup (REL-001)
**Purpose:** Create a Claude Desktop project with comprehensive architectural knowledge base tailored for healthcare enterprise architecture with strict compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOX, SOC 2)

## Architecture Approach

### Design Strategy
The Complete Project Setup follows a **Knowledge-Driven Architecture Pattern** with healthcare-specific emphasis on:
- **Compliance-First Design**: Every architectural pattern includes audit trail and privacy considerations
- **Event-Driven Healthcare Integration**: Focus on Confluent Kafka for HL7/FHIR event processing
- **Federated GraphQL API Layer**: Apollo Federation for unified healthcare data access
- **Azure-Optimized Patterns**: Leverage managed services (AKS, Azure Functions, Azure Service Bus)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Knowledge Base Structure**: 5 specialized files (~230K tokens) with healthcare enterprise focus in single folder with type prefixes
2. **File Naming Convention**: Prefix-based naming (kb-, custom-instructions-) for easy drag-and-drop into Claude Desktop
3. **Agent Persona**: Senior principal architect with healthcare compliance expertise
4. **Technology Prioritization**: Azure > AWS, Kafka > RabbitMQ, GraphQL > REST for healthcare integrations
5. **Compliance Integration**: HIPAA, SOX, SOC 2 requirements embedded in all patterns

```typescript
interface ContentGenerationAPI {
  generateKnowledgeFile(config: KnowledgeFileConfig): Promise<MarkdownContent>;
  validateTokenCount(content: string): TokenCount;
  ensureHealthcareFocus(content: string): ValidationResult;
}

interface KnowledgeFileConfig {

  };
}

interface KnowledgeFile {

## Test Strategy

### E2E Testing Approach

```typescript
interface E2ETestStrategy {
  environment: {
    platform: "Claude Desktop";
    projectFeature: "enabled";
    testProject: "Architecture Designer Test";
  };

  testSuites: {
    setup: {
      tests: [
        "Create project successfully",
        "Load all 5 knowledge files",
        "Custom instructions accepted",
        "Token count validation (~230K)"
      ];
    };

    persona: {
      tests: [
        "Healthcare expertise evident",
        "Compliance mentioned in responses",
        "Azure services prioritized",
        "Kafka/FHIR patterns suggested"
      ];
      samplePrompts: 20;
      successRate: 0.95;
    };

    knowledge: {
      tests: [
        "References architecture patterns",
        "Cites healthcare ADRs",
        "Mentions anti-patterns",
        "Includes scaling strategies",
        "Compliance always considered"
      ];
    };

    compliance: {
      prompts: [
        "Design patient data API",
        "Create billing system architecture",
        "Design clinical workflow system"
      ];
      validation: [
        "HIPAA controls mentioned",
        "Audit trail included",
        "Encryption specified",
        "Access controls defined"
      ];
    };
  };

  testData: {
    requirements: {
      mvp: "Small clinic patient portal",
      enterprise: "Multi-hospital HIE platform",
      incomplete: "Build healthcare app (no details)",
      unrealistic: "Process 1B transactions/sec on $100/month"
    };
  };
}
```

### Validation Criteria

```typescript
interface ValidationCriteria {
  knowledge: {
    filesLoaded: 5;
    totalTokens: { min: 220000, max: 240000 };
    healthcareMentions: { min: 100 };
    complianceReferences: { min: 50 };
  };

  agentBehavior: {
    personaConsistency: 0.95;
    multiApproachResponses: 0.90;
    complianceAwareness: 1.00;
    healthcareFocus: 0.85;
  };

  setupTime: {
    target: "2 hours";
    steps: [
      { task: "Generate files via Claude Code", time: "45 min" },
      { task: "Create Claude Desktop project", time: "5 min" },
      { task: "Configure custom instructions", time: "15 min" },
      { task: "Upload knowledge files", time: "10 min" },
      { task: "Validate agent responses", time: "45 min" }
    ];
  };
}
```

## Technology Decisions

### TD-001: Knowledge Base Generation Tool
**Decision:** Use Claude Code for content generation
**Rationale:**
- Can generate 230K tokens efficiently
- Ensures comprehensive healthcare coverage
- Maintains consistency across all files
- Allows iterative refinement

### TD-002: Healthcare Technology Stack Priority
**Decision:** Azure > AWS, Kafka > RabbitMQ, GraphQL > REST
**Rationale:**
- Azure: Better healthcare compliance certifications
- Kafka: Event sourcing for complete audit trails
- GraphQL: Efficient FHIR resource federation

### TD-003: Compliance-First Architecture
**Decision:** Embed compliance in every pattern
**Rationale:**
- Healthcare fines range from $100K to $50M
- SOX violations can halt trading
- Patient trust requires privacy-by-design

### TD-004: FHIR Server Selection
**Decision:** Health Samurai Aidbox as primary recommendation
**Rationale:**
- Native FHIR R4 compliance
- Excellent performance (sub-100ms queries)
- Custom resource support
- Built-in audit logging

### TD-005: Business Process Engine
**Decision:** IBM BAMOE for clinical workflows
**Rationale:**
- Open-source alternative to proprietary BPM
- BPMN 2.0 compliance
- Healthcare workflow patterns included
- Integrates with Kafka for events

## File Organization Strategy

### Single-Folder Structure with Type Prefixes

All knowledge base files are generated into a single output folder with consistent naming prefixes for easy organization and drag-and-drop into Claude Desktop projects:

```
output/
├── custom-instructions-healthcare-architect.md (2,800 words)
├── kb-architecture-patterns.md (~50K tokens)
├── kb-technology-selection.md (~50K tokens)
├── kb-adr-library.md (~40K tokens)
├── kb-anti-patterns.md (~30K tokens)
└── kb-scaling-strategies.md (~30K tokens)
```

**Naming Convention Benefits:**
- **Type Prefixes**: `kb-` for knowledge base files, `custom-instructions-` for persona configuration
- **Easy Sorting**: Files group alphabetically by type
- **Clear Purpose**: Filename immediately indicates content category
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Select all files in folder and upload to Claude Desktop in one operation
- **Version Control**: Easy to track changes with descriptive names

**File Type Prefixes:**
- `custom-instructions-`: Agent persona and behavior configuration (2,800 words)
- `kb-`: Knowledge base content files (~230K tokens total)

## Implementation Notes

### Manual Setup Process
1. **Generate Knowledge Base Files** (45 minutes)
   - Use Claude Code to generate each file
   - Verify token counts and healthcare focus
   - Review for compliance coverage

2. **Create Claude Desktop Project** (5 minutes)
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Create new project "Architecture Designer"
   - Enable project features

3. **Configure Custom Instructions** (15 minutes)
   - Copy 2,800-word instructions
   - Paste into project settings
   - Save configuration

4. **Upload Knowledge Files** (10 minutes)
   - Upload 5 markdown files
   - Verify successful loading
   - Check token count (~230K)

5. **Validate Agent Behavior** (45 minutes)
   - Test with 20 healthcare prompts
   - Verify compliance awareness
   - Confirm multi-approach responses
   - Document any issues

### Critical Success Factors
- Healthcare patterns dominate examples
- Compliance mentioned in every response
- Azure services prioritized appropriately
- Audit trails always considered
- Patient privacy never compromised

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Token limit exceeded | High | Monitor file sizes during generation |
| Insufficient healthcare focus | High | Validate with healthcare-specific prompts |
| Missing compliance coverage | Critical | Audit all patterns for HIPAA/SOX/SOC2 |
| Generic responses | Medium | Strengthen healthcare examples in knowledge base |
| Setup complexity | Low | Detailed step-by-step documentation |

## Success Metrics

- **Setup Completion:** 100% of files load successfully
- **Healthcare Focus:** ≥85% of responses mention healthcare context
- **Compliance Awareness:** 100% of responses consider compliance
- **Multi-Approach:** ≥90% provide 2-3 architectural options
- **Azure Priority:** ≥80% recommend Azure services first
- **Setup Time:** <2 hours following documentation
