# Requirements Specification

## Feature Overview
**Feature Name:** Complete Project Setup (REL-001)
**Description:** Configure a Claude Desktop project with custom instructions and comprehensive knowledge base files to create an Architecture Designer agent that acts as a senior principal architect with 25+ years of experience
**Priority:** High (10.0/10.0 - Foundation Release)

## User Stories

### Story 1: Configure Claude Desktop Project
**As a** Software Architect
**I want** to set up a new Claude Desktop project with custom instructions and knowledge base files
**So that** I can access an AI agent that provides expert architecture guidance with comprehensive knowledge

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)
- **Given** I have access to Claude Desktop with Projects feature enabled
- **When** I create a new project named "Architecture Designer"
- **Then** I can configure custom instructions defining the agent persona and workflow
- **And** the custom instructions are 2,800 words defining senior principal architect behavior

- **Given** I have the custom instructions configured
- **When** I upload the 5 knowledge base markdown files
- **Then** all files load successfully without errors
- **And** the total knowledge base is approximately 230K tokens

- **Given** the project is fully configured
- **When** I test with a sample architecture question
- **Then** the agent responds with the senior principal architect persona
- **And** the agent references content from the knowledge base files

### Story 2: Generate Knowledge Base Content
**As a** Software Architect
**I want** to generate comprehensive knowledge base content using Claude Code
**So that** I have all required reference materials for the Architecture Designer agent

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)
- **Given** I need to create the architecture-patterns-library.md file
- **When** I use Claude Code to generate the content
- **Then** the file contains 12+ architectural patterns (Monolithic, Microservices, Event-Driven, Serverless, etc.)
- **And** the file is approximately 50K tokens with real-world examples and decision frameworks

- **Given** I need to create the technology-selection-guide.md file
- **When** I use Claude Code to generate the content
- **Then** the file contains decision frameworks for backend languages, databases, message queues, frontend frameworks, and cloud providers
- **And** the decision framework is weighted: 40% Team Expertise, 20% Community/Ecosystem, 15% Performance, 10% Scalability, 10% Development Velocity, 5% Maintainability

- **Given** I need to create the adr-library.md file
- **When** I use Claude Code to generate the content
- **Then** the file contains ADR template and 10-15 real-world examples
- **And** the file is approximately 40K tokens covering database selection, API design, authentication approaches, etc.

- **Given** I need to create the anti-patterns-case-studies.md file
- **When** I use Claude Code to generate the content
- **Then** the file contains 15+ detailed anti-pattern case studies
- **And** each case study includes what went wrong, financial/team impact, red flags, how to fix/avoid, and key lessons

- **Given** I need to create the scaling-strategies.md file
- **When** I use Claude Code to generate the content
- **Then** the file contains scaling curve guidance for different phases (0-1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, 100K-1M users)
- **And** includes real-world scaling case studies from companies like Shopify, Netflix, Instagram, Stack Overflow

### Story 3: Validate Agent Persona and Responses
**As a** Senior Engineer
**I want** to verify the agent responds with appropriate architectural guidance
**So that** I can trust the recommendations for production systems

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)
- **Given** the project is fully configured with custom instructions and knowledge base
- **When** I ask the agent about architecture patterns for a specific use case
- **Then** the agent provides 2-3 distinct architectural approaches with Mermaid diagrams
- **And** presents honest tradeoffs without silver bullets

- **Given** I provide incomplete requirements
- **When** the agent analyzes them
- **Then** the agent identifies and flags critical gaps (missing performance targets, unclear scale expectations)
- **And** prompts for missing critical information before proceeding

- **Given** I request technology recommendations
- **When** the agent evaluates options
- **Then** recommendations are weighted by team expertise first (40% weight)
- **And** the agent provides specific versions and justifications, not vague suggestions

### Story 4: Document Setup Process
**As a** Software Architect
**I want** clear documentation of the manual setup process
**So that** other architects can replicate the configuration for their teams

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)
- **Given** I need to share the setup process with my team
- **When** I follow the documented setup instructions
- **Then** I can complete the entire configuration in under 2 hours
- **And** each step is clearly documented with expected outcomes

- **Given** the setup documentation exists
- **When** another architect follows it independently
- **Then** they successfully create a functioning Architecture Designer project
- **And** the agent exhibits the same persona and capabilities

## Business Rules
- Knowledge base files must be generated using Claude Code to ensure comprehensive content (230K tokens total)
- Custom instructions must define agent as senior principal architect with 25+ years experience
- Agent must always present multiple approaches (2-3) with honest tradeoffs, never single mandates
- Technology recommendations must be weighted primarily by team expertise (40%) over theoretical best practices
- Agent must challenge unrealistic expectations and flag critical requirement gaps
- All architectural recommendations must reference patterns and case studies from knowledge base

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Knowledge base files must load within 30 seconds in Claude Desktop
- **Security:** No sensitive company data in initial knowledge base (generic patterns only)
- **Accessibility:** Documentation must be readable in standard markdown viewers
- **Compatibility:** Must work with current Claude Desktop Projects feature (January 2025)

## Testing Requirements
- **E2E Tests:**
  - Complete project setup workflow from empty project to functioning agent
  - Test agent with 20 different architecture prompts to validate persona consistency (≥95% correct persona)
  - Verify all 5 knowledge base files are accessible through agent responses
  - Test with incomplete requirements to verify gap identification behavior

- **Test Environment:**
  - Claude Desktop application with Projects feature enabled
  - Test project separate from production project
  - Sample architecture requirements for validation

- **Test Data:**
  - Sample requirements for MVP web application (small team, tight budget)
  - Sample requirements for enterprise system (large team, complex requirements)
  - Deliberately incomplete requirements missing key constraints
  - Unrealistic requirements to test pushback behavior

## Dependencies
- **Claude Desktop Projects Feature**: Must be enabled in user's Claude Desktop application (External - Anthropic Platform Team)
- **Claude Code Access**: Required to generate the 230K tokens of knowledge base content efficiently
- **Mermaid Diagram Support**: Claude Desktop must support Mermaid diagram rendering for architecture visualizations

## Out of Scope
- **Company-specific knowledge base files**: Organization-specific standards, internal patterns, compliance requirements (Deferred to Future Capabilities)
- **Quarterly knowledge base updates**: Regular updates to framework versions and cost estimates (Deferred to Future Capabilities)
- **Automated setup process**: This is a manual configuration process, not automated tooling
- **Integration with architecture review workflows**: No connection to formal review processes or approval workflows
- **Cost estimation capabilities**: Infrastructure cost estimates for recommended architectures (Deferred to Future Capabilities)
- **Evolution path planning**: Detailed roadmaps showing architecture evolution from MVP to 1M+ users (Deferred to Future Capabilities)

## Success Metrics
- **Project Configuration Success**: 100% of knowledge base files load without errors (measured at deployment)
- **Agent Persona Validation**: Agent responds with architect persona in ≥95% of test interactions (measured via 20 test prompts)
- **Knowledge Base Accessibility**: Users can reference all 5 knowledge base files through agent responses (measured via spot-check queries)
- **Setup Time**: Complete configuration achievable in under 2 hours following documentation
- **Content Generation Success**: Claude Code generates all 5 files totaling ~230K tokens without manual writing
